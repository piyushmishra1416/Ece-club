# Contribution Guidelines
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the code base (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch.
2. Fix issue.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Mention issue id in pull request description. Example: #123.
5. Issue that pull request!



## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/piyushmishra1416/Ece-club/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/piyushmishra1416/Ece-club/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
